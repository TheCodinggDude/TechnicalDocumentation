      C is a programming language developed at AT & T's Bell laboratory in USA
      in 1972. It was designed and written by Dennis Ritchie. C quickly became
      popular because it is simple, reliable and easy to use. In an industry
      where new technologies come and go every day, a language that has survived
      for 3 years has to be really good.
    </p>
    <h4>Why you should learn C?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is very difficult to learn C++ or Java directly.This is because while
        learning these languages you have to learn about OOPS concepts. Learning
        such complicated concepts while you are not even comfortable with basic
        concepts is like pulling the cart before the horse. Hence one should
        learn all language elements very thoroughly using C before migrating to
        C++/Java/Python.
      </li>
      <li>
        Major parts of Windows operating system such as Windows, UNIX, Linux is
        still written in C. Hence when it comes to performance, nothing beats C.
      </li>
      <li>
        Electronic devices such as Microwave Oven, Washing Machine and digital
        cameras use a program embedded in their devices. They not only have to
        run fast but also have to work in limited amount of memory. They are
        also written in C language.
      </li>
      <li>Many popular gaming frameworks are also built using C language.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="charset">C character set</h3>
    <p>
      The below figure shows valid alphabets, numbers and symbols allowed in C.

    </center>
    <h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>
    <p>
      Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its
      execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
    </p>

    <h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
    <p>
      A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs
      can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines
      the size and the variable's memory, the range of values that can be stored
      within that memory and the set of operations that can be applied to the
      variable.
    </p>
    <h3 id="keywords">Keywords</h3>
    <p>
      Keywords are the words whose meaning has already been explained to the C
      compiler. The keywords canot be used as variable name because if we do we
      are trying to assign a new meaning to the keyword,which is not allowed by
      the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 32 keywords available in C. Following is the list of keywords in
      C

    <h3 id="identifier">Identifiers</h3>
    <p>
      Identifier refers to name given to entities such as variables, functions,
      structures etc. Identifiers must be unique. They are created to give a
      unique name to an entity to identify it during the execution of the
      program. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      int money;
      <br />
      double accountBalance;
    </p>
    <h4>Rules for naming Identifiers</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A valid identifier can have letters (both uppercase and lowercase
        letters), digits and underscores.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first letter of an identifier should be either a letter or an
        underscore.
      </li>
      <li>You cannot use keywords like int, break etc. as identifiers.</li>
      <li>
        There is no rule on how long an identifier can be. However, you may run
        into problems in some compilers if the identifier is longer than 31
        characters.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="operator">Operators</h3>
    <p>
      An operator is a symbol that operates on one or more values or variables.
      For example: + is an operator to perform addition.
    </p>
    <p>C has a wide range of operators to perform various operations.</p>

        <h4>Increment and Decrement Operators</h4>
        <p>
          C programming has two operators increment (<strong>++</strong>) and
          decrement (<strong>--</strong>) to change the value of an operand
          (constant or variable) by 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Increment (<strong>++</strong>) increases the value by 1 whereas
          decrement (<strong>--</strong>) decreases the value by 1. These two
          operators are unary operators, meaning they only operate on a single
          operand.
        </p>

        <h4>Relational Operators</h4>
        <p>
          A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. If
          the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it
          returns value 0.
        </p>
        <p>Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.</p>

        <p>
          An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1
          depending upon whether expression results true or false. Logical
          operators are commonly used in decision making in C programming.

          During computation, mathematical operations like: addition,
          subtraction, multiplication, division, etc are converted to bit-level
          which makes processing faster and saves power.
        </p>
        <p>

    <h3 id="rules">Rules applicable to all C programs</h3>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>
        Each instruction in a C program is written as a seperate statement.
        Therefore a complete C program would comprise of a series of statements.
      </li>
      <li>
        The statements in the program must appear in the same order in which we
        wish them to be executed.
      </li>
      <li>All statements are entered in lowercase letters.</li>
      <li>
        Every C statement must end with a <strong>;</strong>. Therefore
        <strong>;</strong> acts as a <em>statement terminator</em>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="datatype">Data Types</h3>
    <p>
      In C programming, data types are declarations for variables. They
      determine the type and size of data associated with variables. For
      example :
    </p>
    <p>int var;</p>
    <p>Here var is variable of <em>int</em> type and its size is 4 bytes.</p>

    <h3>Primitive Data type</h3>
    <h4><u><em>int</em> Data type</u></h4>
    <p>Integers are whole numbers that can have both zero, positive and negative values but no decimal values. int can take 2<sup>32</sup> distinct states from -2147483648 to 2147483647.</p>
    <p>You can declare multiple variables at once in C programming. For example,</p>
    <p>int rollNo,age;</p>
    <h4><u><em>char</em> Data type</u></h4>
    <p>Keyword <em>char</em> is used for declaring character type variables. The size of the character variable is 1 byte. For example,</p>
    <p>char ch = 'a';</p>
    <h4><u><em>float and double</em> Data type</u></h4>
    <p>float and double are used to hold real numbers. For example,</p>
    <p>float salary;</p>
    <p>double price;</p>
    <p>In C, floating-point numbers can also be represented in exponential. For example,</p>
    <div>float G = 6.674e-11;</div>
    <h3>Data Type Modifiers</h3>
    <h4><u><em>short and long</em></u></h4>
    <p>short variables are used to hold short integers by using keyword <em>short</em>. Whereas long variables are used to hold long integers by using keyword <em>long</em>.</p>
    <div>shorts are at least 2 bytes big and long are at least 4 bytes big. The value of long integer typically vary from <strong>-2147483648</strong> to <strong>+2147483647</strong></div>
    <h4><u><em>signed and unsigned</em></u></h4>
    <div>When we know that the data that will be stored in an int variable will always be positive, we use unsigned modifier. For example,</div>
    <div>unsigned int num_of_students;</div>
